1) start discarding bad strategy, ideally we stay with max 3/4 strategies. 
    - they should be strategy you can hyperopt
2) hyperopt them 
3) make a bulktest where you can test them all in one hit over several period 
    - select a test name 
4) make a strategy that is able to detect trand (side,up,down)
    - select the proper hyperopted strategy according to which one performed better in which period 

5) now take a look a mgm and see if you can integrate in this framework
